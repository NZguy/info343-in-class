 * be of any type. Getting or setting a value given a
 * key is very fast.

//that using an alternative syntax:
var propName1 = "curriculum";
var propName2 = "num";
console.log("Alternative syntax: I'm taking", course[propName1], course[propName2]);

//you can also test if an object has a property already
//using two different approaches:
//first: use .hasOwnProperty()
if (course.hasOwnProperty("title")) {
    console.log(course.title);
}
//second: test the value for the property,
//asking for a property that doesn't yet exist
//in the HashMap will return `undefined`, which
//will coerce to false
if (course.foobar) {
    //this won't ever run because there is no
    //`foobar` key in the HashMap, so 
    //course.foobar returns undefined
    console.log(course.foobar);

//using Object.keys(). This returns an array of strings,
//one element for each property name

 * 
 *   curriculum = INFO
 *   num = 343
 *   section = D

//Because the data/babynames-1996.js file was added
//to our index.html page before this script, we can
//access the global variable BABYNAMES, which that
//file declares. That variable is set to an array
//of objects, each of which has three properties:
//name, sex, and count.

//how many elements are in the BABYNAMES array?
//every array has a `.length` property
console.log("BABYNAMES has %s elements", 
    formatAsNumber(BABYNAMES.length));

//every array also has a .filter() method, which 
//returns a new array containing only the elements
//that pass your testing function. Your testing 
//function should return `true` if the element should
//be in the returned filtered array, or `false` if not

//the testing function you pass to .filter() 
//is called once for each element in the array, 
//and it's passed that current element
//as the first parameter--here we call it `record`
//but since it's our parameter, we can call it
//whatever we want to.
var females = BABYNAMES.filter(function(record) {
    return "F" == record.sex;
});

    return "M" == record.sex;
});

console.log("There are %s female names and %s males names", 
    formatAsNumber(females.length), formatAsNumber(males.length));

//every array also has a `.sort()` method, which will sort
//the array elements in-place according to your compare
//function. The compare function will be called many
//times, and each time the sort algorithm will pass it
//two elements from the array. The compare function must
//return a negative number if the first element is 
//"less than" the second, return 0 if they are equal,
//or return a positive number if the first element is
//"greater than" the second element

//let's sort the females and males arrays by count ascending
//(least popular names at the top)
females.sort(function(record1, record2) {
    //since count is a number, we can just subtract them;
    //if record1.count is < than record2.count, the result
    //will be negative; if they are equal, the result will
    //be 0; if record1.count > record2.count, the result
    //will be positive
    return record1.count - record2.count;
});

//every array has a `.slice()` method that you can use
//to slice off a range of the array elements
var leastPopFemRecs = females.slice(0,10);
console.log("least popular female name records:", leastPopFemRecs);

//every array also has a .forEach() method, which will
//call the supplied function once for each element,
//passing that element as the first parameter
var leastPopFemNames = [];
leastPopFemRecs.forEach(function(record) {
    leastPopFemNames.push(record.name);
});

//but there's a more elegant way to extract just
//a portion of each array element...

//every array also has a `.map()` method, which will
//return a new array containing the same number of elements
//but each element will be transformed using your 
//transformation function
//this transformation function returns only the .name
//property from each record, so the returned array will
//contain only the names (it will be an array of strings) 
leastPopFemNames = leastPopFemRecs.map(function(record) {
    //return just the name property
    return record.name;
});

console.log("least popular female names:", leastPopFemNames);

//this is how `.map()` is actually implemented...
function mapArray(array, transFn) {
    var mappedElems = [];
    var idx;
    for (idx = 0; idx < array.length; idx++) {
        mappedElems.push(transFn(array[idx]));
    }
    return mappedElems;
}
//but you don't have to implement it--just use the .map() method!

//arrays also have a `.join()` method, which will join all
//of the elements into one single output string, using
//the separator string you provide
console.log("least popular female names:", leastPopFemNames.join(", "));

//although we are passing anonymous inline functions above,
//we can also pass a reference to a function defined elsewhere
var badlyEncryptedNames = leastPopFemNames.map(badlyEncryptText);
var badlyDecryptedNames = badlyEncryptedNames.map(badlyDecryptText);

console.log("badly encrypted least popular female names:", badlyEncryptedNames.join(", "));
console.log("badly decrypted least popular female names:", badlyDecryptedNames.join(", "));

//arrays also have a `.reduce()` method, which is tricky to
//understand, but it's super powerful. It calls your reducer
//function once for each element in the array, passing the
//current reduction value, and the current element. whatever
//your reducer function returns will become the new reduction
//value.
//for example, to sum all of the .count properties in the
//array of baby name records, we could do this:
var totalCount = BABYNAMES.reduce(function(curTotal, record) {
    return curTotal + record.count;
}, 0); //second param is the starting reduction value

console.log("Total count", formatAsNumber(totalCount));

/**
 * PRACTICE
 * now sort the `males` array by count *descending*
 * and slice off the top 10 records. Then use `.map()`
 * to extract transform that top 10 array of records
 * into a array of 10 strings. Then use .join() to
 * write that array of 10 strings to the console as
 * a comma, delimited list. To sort descending,
 * just reverse the logic in your compare function.
 */



/**
 * PRACTICE
 * There are many names in the BABYNAMES array that
 * were used for both females and males, so the same
 * name appears twice, once with a count for females
 * and once with a count for males. 
 * Given that the keys of a JavaScript object are 
 * a unique set, and given that you can associate 
 * a value with each of those keys, write the code
 * to extract the distinct set of names, and as
 * you do so, calculate the total number of babies
 * who were given that name. Then sort the resulting
 * data by total count descending, slice off the 
 * top 10 and write those to the console.
