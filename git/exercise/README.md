# Git In-Class Exercise

Now that you know something about git and GitHub, let's see if you can complete the following exercise. You can work together with a partner or work alone. You can also refer to the [Essential Git Tutorial](http://faculty.washington.edu/dlsinfo/tutorials/essential-git/) or any other resource on the web, but try to rely on your memory first&mdash;you want this to become second-nature. If you get stuck, raise your hand and the TA or I will come by to help.

If you don't finish this before the end of class, come back for the lab section and finish it then.

## Fork and Clone

1. If you were in class, you already forked this repo into your own account, but if you haven't done that yet, [fork this repo](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) so that you have your own copy of it and can make changes to it. You will do all in-class exercises in your forked copy of this repo.
1. [Clone this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) to your development machine if you haven't already done so.

## Add Some Files to a Feature Branch

1. Using the terminal on your development machine, create a new branch named `my-feature` within this repository and switch to it.
1. Within this `git/exercise/` directory, create a new `index.html` file. Populate that file with the HTML necessary for a [basic web page](http://faculty.washington.edu/dlsinfo/tutorials/essential-html/). Put something in the `<body>` section so you can see something on-screen.
1. Add and commit the new file to the `my-feature` branch.
1. Push the `my-feature` branch to GitHub.

## Publish to GitHub Pages

1. Switch to the `gh-pages` branch in your repo and merge all commits made to the `my-feature` branch into the `gh-pages` branch. We created this `gh-pages` branch in class, so if you were not in class, you will need to create the `gh-pages` branch first.
1. Push the `gh-pages` branch to GitHub to publish your new `index.html` file on the web.
1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to the following URL, replacing `your-user-name` with your GitHub username: `https://your-user-name.github.io/info343-in-class/git/exercises/index.html`. You should see your web page. If you don't, check your repository settings to ensure that your GitHub Pages site was published successfully.

## Create a Pull Request and Merge

1. Over on GitHub, create a new pull request to merge commits from the `my-feature` branch into the `master` branch. If you are working with a partner, have your partner review your code and approve it. If not, pretend like you are a different developer reviewing your pull request. Feel free to add comments, just so you can see what those look like. After reviewing, accept the changes by merging the pull request.
1. Back in your terminal, switch back to the `master` branch, and pull the new commits from the merged pull request into your local development repo.

## Create a Second Feature Branch

1. Back in your terminal, create a new branch named `other-feature`.
1. Within this `git/exercises/` directory, create a new sub-directory named `css` and put a file named `main.css` in that new directory.
1. Add a style rule that changes the [`background-color`](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-color.asp) of the [body element](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_element.asp) to `#F0F0F0` (light grey) or some other color that you will easily notice.
1. In your `git/exercises/index.html` file, add the appropriate element to the `<head>` section to [link](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_link.asp) your `index.css` to this page. Open your local `index.html` file in your browser to ensure that the body background color has changed.
1. Add, commit, and push the `other-feature` branch to GitHub.

## Merge into gh-pages

1. Your new CSS changes are now in the `other-feature` brach on GitHub but they won't yet be visible on the web because they haven't been merged into the `gh-pages` branch. In your terminal, switch to the `gh-pages` branch and merge the new commits from the `other-feature` branch.
1. After the new commits are merged, push them up to GitHub.
1. Refresh your browser to see the updated page with the different background color!

## Pull Request to Master

1. Over on GitHub, create another pull request to merge your new commits from the `other-feature` branch into `master`. Pretend like you have done a code review, and then Merge the pull request.
1. This time, also create a [new release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) named `v1.0` based on the current state of the `master` branch. Releases are a way you can signal to others that the code at this point is ready to be used in production. It also creates a mnemonic tag that you can use to easily check out a previous release to see what the code looked like at that point. 
1. Back in your terminal, switch to the `master` branch and pull the new commits from GitHub.
